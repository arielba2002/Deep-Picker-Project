## Step 1: Set Up PostgreSQL with Docker

1. **Pull the PostgreSQL Docker Image**

   To run PostgreSQL in a container, first pull the official PostgreSQL image:

   ```bash
   docker pull postgres

2. **Run PostgreSQL Container**
   ```bash
   docker run --name my-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=mydb -p 5432:5432 -d postgres

## Step 2: Set Up Python Backend

1. **Install Required Libraries**

   ```bash
   cd app/backend/
   poetry install
   ```
   This will install all the necessary dependencies as defined in the pyproject.toml file.

## Step 3: Run the FastAPI Application
   Once the dependencies are installed, run the FastAPI server using Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry run start
   ```
   This will start the FastAPI application with the command defined in the pyproject.toml file.
